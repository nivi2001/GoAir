# GoAir
Hello Everyone

This is my first automation project in Cypress. I have automated flight booking website "Go Air" using page object model.
I have uploaded automation test scripts of following pages:
1. GoAir Search Flight Page
2. GoAir Airline Tickets and Fares

All the testscripts can be found in /cypress/integration/examples/GoAir.

Pageobject definitions are present in /cypress/support/pageObjects.

Test data are in folder /fixtures/.

Last test run logs can be found in /cypress/videos/examples/GoAir

Regards
Nibriti Singh
